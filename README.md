#Web Script Programming
This repository is home to the coursework for my university module "Web Script Programming."

The premise of this coursework is to have a web server that serves a page to an unattended display, which is controlled
from a configuration page that can be accessed through a specific URL to the server.

For my specific use case I chose to have the unattended display as an information tool on a lecturers office door, the idea
being to let students and staff know whether or not the lecturer is busy, available or wanting to display something potentially
inspirational to students an staff.
